Hi this is Erik

I want to write this blog to track my thoughts on technology and society. This will include the effects of technology in people, cool ideas, security in the digital life, economics and some code snippets from time to time.

If something resonates with you, please jump into the discussion and reach out at erik.bacilio@gmail.com or @cazsol(https://twitter.com/cazsol) at twitter!

Cheers!
