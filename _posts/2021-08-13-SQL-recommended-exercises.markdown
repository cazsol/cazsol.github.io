Now that I have completed the certification on Keras and Tensorflow, I think  I have to work a bit on SQL to ensure I can process data correctly when working with the models. So, I remembered Eric Weber posted on Linkedin a list with useful resources to learn SQL and I am posting it here to have it as reference for the future:

1. Zachary Thomas' SQL Questions https://lnkd.in/g-JJzuD
2. Select * SQL: https://selectstarsql.com/
3. Leetcode: https://lnkd.in/g3c5JGC
4. LinkedIn Learning: https://lnkd.in/gQXFc4n
5. Window Functions: https://lnkd.in/g3RtPCJ
6. HackerRank: https://lnkd.in/grv_9sB
7. W3 Schools: https://lnkd.in/gJPfrrv
8. CodeAcademy: https://lnkd.in/gT5xmpN
9. SQLZoo: https://sqlzoo.net/
10. SQL Bolt: https://sqlbolt.com/

By the way, I am also considering reproduce the book “An Introduction to Statistical Learning” in Python. The book is written to be used along R, but I think I rather hone my skills in Python. Maybe I will learn R, the next year!

I have not forgotten the VPN set up! However, I have been really busy at work and I cannot focus on setting up the second raspberry that will work as a client for my set up.

Will share more details soon.

See you space cowboy!
