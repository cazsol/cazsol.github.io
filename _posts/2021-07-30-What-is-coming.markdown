Hi,

I am planning to have some discipline regarding keeping this blog up to date. This means that I will try to write on a daily basis, even if the content is not that relevant. 

One of the reasons I want to write this blog, not mentioned in the About section, is that I want to practice my writting in another environment other than work. 

So bear with me!

What is coming? I am planning to write a DIY guide on setting up a VPN using a Raspberry Pi using Open VPN. I know there are a lot of guides out there, but to be honest I found most of them pretty bad at explaining some core concepts and focused on just giving yout the commands. I will try to do a better job explaining what is going on and learn about it in the process. Talk to you tomorrow.

Peace out!
