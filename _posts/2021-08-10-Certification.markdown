I have missed multiple days from posting due to my work but also due to coursework to complete my first certification. Last week I had my last class and examination on deep learning with Keras and Tensorflow. I really liked the material and found most of the course as a great learning experience. Particularly the labs were great chance to learn step by step. I did not enjoyed the live classes that much, but I have to admit I still learned a lot. 

It was a good experience and know I am more confortable creating models from scratch, which will help me to work on the basics using some kaggle data. 

Lotâ€™s of work and more to come.

See you space cowboy!
